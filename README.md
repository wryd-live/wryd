# WRYD Android App

This app will allow you to use your phone to perform constant scans of Bluetooth and WiFi signals and levels that can be associated with certain locations in your home to allow internal positioning.

WRYD is an innovative Android application that leverages Indoor Positioning System with WiFi technology to create a social networking platform for users in indoor spaces. The app is designed to enable users to connect with like-minded people in their vicinity and share their interests and hobbies.

In addition to social networking features, the app also provides useful information about the building, such as the location of restrooms, restaurants, and other amenities. Users can also use the app to locate friends who are attending events or gatherings within the building.

The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a simple and easy-to-use interface. It is also customizable, allowing users to adjust settings and preferences to suit their needs.

Overall, WRYD is a unique and innovative app that combines the benefits of social networking with the convenience of indoor positioning technology.
